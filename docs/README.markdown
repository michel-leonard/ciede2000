Based on our JavaScript implementation, you can see the CIEDE2000 color difference formula in action here :
- A [tool](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000) that identify the name of the selected color based on a picture.
- A [discovery generator](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000/samples.html) for quick, small-scale testing and exploration.
- A [large-scale generator](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000/batch.html) used to validate new implementations.
- A [simple calculator](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000/calculator.html) of the **Î”E 2000**, given two L\*a\*b\* colors.
